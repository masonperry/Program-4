In class we learned about functions, and what they are used for. Functions are to
better organize and compress a form of code. For this assignment I was to revisit
lab 2 and compress and organize it.

Important Variables:
add, subtract, multiply, and divide each contain their respective operation.
add_pos, sub_pos, mult_pos, and div_pos, are assigned to find the operation
position.
a_store, commits addition to memory.
s_store, commits subtraction to memory.
m_store, commits multiplication to memory.
d_store, commits division to memory.
value, is suppose to store user input based on the last operation they entered.
inValid is assigned to tell if the user input is invalid.

The code is to operate a simple calculator, with a memory bank. If the memory
bank works I am not so sure. The function code neatly organized each operation into a neat block
and the use of finding the operation makes sure a numeric value is being entered.

The only major problems I encountered was again not fully understanding Functions.
That, and Memory, I absolutely certain my code to store expressions is not working.
